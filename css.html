    <h2>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</h2>

    <p>
        Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, lit. 'National Volunteer Union' or 'National Volunteer Corps') 
        is an Indian right-wing Hindutva volunteer paramilitary organisation. It is the progenitor and leader 
        of a large body of Hindutva organisations called the Sangh Parivar, which includes the Bharatiya Janata 
        Party (BJP), the ruling political party under Narendra Modi. Mohan Bhagwat currently serves as the 
        Sarsanghchalak (Chief) of the RSS, with Dattatreya Hosabale as the Sarkaryavah (General Secretary).

        by membership.

        influenced by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's pamphlet "Essentials of Hindutva" and sought to strengthen 
        Hindu society. He recruited Hindu youth, gave them uniforms, and taught them paramilitary techniques 
        with lathis (bamboo sticks) and swords. The saffron flag, Bhagwa Dhwaj, became the organisation's emblem.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Motivations and History</strong><br>
        The RSS was founded to propagate the ideology of Hindutva and unite Hindus. Hedgewar disagreed with 
        Gandhi’s views on the Khilafat Movement and formed an independent organisation based on Indian trad
